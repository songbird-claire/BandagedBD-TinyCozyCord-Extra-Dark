This is a *BandagedBetterDiscord* Theme to make cozy view more compact, darker, and prettier. :D

This theme incorporates some code from Adjustable Server Width by Gibbu & CleanCompact by kettui, with significant edits, alterations, changes, and incorporations with other code. Also, css-transitions of an appearance similar to those from another developer were self-designed.
